# Project 

For this project, a text-based game will be created. There won't be any visuals outside of text on a command line, unless somehow time is permitted, but very likely not. What this game will be is a simple program demonstrating a battle between an enemy and player. The user will be controlling the player's actions. These actions will be a list of commands that can be used to alter the battle. After selecting a command, it will commence and afterwards the enemy will perform an action. Then repeat. Details such as character statistics, multiple playable characters, and multiple various enemies may be included if time is permitted. The current status of the battle will be shown in the text, along with player options. This will be completed completely by scratch.
