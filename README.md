# Project 

For this project, a text-based game will be created. There won't be any visuals outside of text on a command line, unless somehow time is permitted, but very likely not. What this game will be is a simple program demonstrating a battle between an enemy and player. The user will be controlling the player's actions. These actions will be a list of commands that can be used to alter the battle. After selecting a command, it will commence and afterwards the enemy will perform an action. Then repeat. Details such as character statistics, multiple playable characters, and multiple various enemies may be included if time is permitted. The current status of the battle will be shown in the text, along with player options. This will be completed completely by scratch.

# Persona 1: The intro programmer
Steven, age 19, is a college student at Temple.  He is taking some introductory computer science courses, and has developed
an interest in learning about the basics of user input.  He isn't very interested in reading through the multitude of manuals
and documentation pages around this subject, and is drawn much more to practical examples of the subjects he studies in 
practice, rather than in theory.  He does not have much experience in programming yet, but understands the basics of how to read,
compile, and run java programs.  

Steven plays lots of single player games in his spare time, and because of his tight work schedule as a student, he wants to be able to enjoy his free time, so the game aspect
of learning is a natural draw.  He would download the executable version of the game first, to see how the game runs, then
fork the project into his own github in order to examine how it implements the options presented to him as a player.

# Persona 2: The Avid Gamer
Tyler, age 24, is a professional gamer. He keeps a log of all games he plays. He aims to play and rate every single game in the world. Tyler never graduated college and spends a lot of time at home on his computer. He is a twitch streamer who likes to educate his audience on the vast world of gaming, as well as the many options available to the public. He is interested in games that are not commonly played and not available for popular gaming consoles. The majority of Tyler's twitch audience are between the ages of 16 and 30 years old. He finds that his audience's love for gaming typically overlaps with an interest in coding. 

Tyler is not a proficient coder but his extensive experience in gaming makes him a natural problem solver. He is particularly interested in Text-Based Battle Game because it combines coding and gaming in a way his audience can more easily understand.

# Persona 3: Experienced With Old PC Games
Howard is a 53-year-old man who has had an interest in computers since he was a child, growing up mostly with computer games
with no notable graphics or visual information aside from text. He's still quite familiar with technology and has a basic
understanding of programming, but did not seek a degree in it. In his free time, he enjoys sometimes looking at and playing
games or projects that remind him of the simplicity of the games he would play when he was young. Similarly, he will
occasionally replay the games he would play as a kid. He's antiquated with running and playing games on the command line
and has experience with similar types of games.

# Persona 4: Consulting associate interested in technology
Lucy is a 39 year old pharmaceutical consultant based in Delaware. She has three children and finds it hard to juggle daily tasks. She knows how to use computers and technology in general at the basic level that her job requires. During her spare time she enjoys going to the movies, golfing, and spending time with her family. Although Lucy is not too proficient in technology, her job requires her to travel a lot and she often finds herself bored on these trips while waiting long hours at the aiport and on long flights. She also has a lot of spare time between meetings.

Having a gaming technology at her fingertips whose basic functionality does not require extensive knowledge of usage and does not need internet connectivity will be a useful addition to Lucy's routine. The ease of use will also allow her to introduce it to her children and can be used as a form of relationship building.

# How to Run
To run this program, go to the location of the jarfile in the command line, in out/artifacts/prj_01_turn_based_text_battle_system_jar,
then run java -jar prj-01-turn-based-text-battle-system.jar.  This will execute the main function of our program.

# How to Install
To install this program, you simply need to download it to your local computer from our github repo.  The current method we 
employ to create our jarFile is to use our IDE of choice to add it as an artifact, but we are working on creating an executable
version of the project soon.  At that stage, you will simply need to download and run it by clicking on it in your file explorer.

# Vision statement

For anyone who is interested in Role Playing Games with access to technology who needs a simple and efficient text based game that is interactive and exciting. The Text Battle System is a gaming application that is easy to manipulate and use as a form of entertainment or a way to de-stress. Unlike other services and providers that offer command line gaming, our product is more user friendy, is open-source, and can be further modified to satisfy the needs of the user if any.
