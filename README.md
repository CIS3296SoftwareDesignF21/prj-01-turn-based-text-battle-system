# Project 

For this project, a text-based game will be created. There won't be any visuals outside of text on a command line, unless somehow time is permitted, but very likely not. What this game will be is a simple program demonstrating a battle between an enemy and player. The user will be controlling the player's actions. These actions will be a list of commands that can be used to alter the battle. After selecting a command, it will commence and afterwards the enemy will perform an action. Then repeat. Details such as character statistics, multiple playable characters, and multiple various enemies may be included if time is permitted. The current status of the battle will be shown in the text, along with player options. This will be completed completely by scratch.


# Persona 1: The intro programmer
Steven, age 19, is a college student at Temple.  He is taking some introductory computer science courses, and has developed
an interest in learning about the basics of user input.  He isn't very interested in reading through the multitude of manuals
and documentation pages around this subject, and is drawn much more to practical examples of the subjects he studies in 
practice, rather than in theory.  He does not have much experience in programming yet, but understands the basics of how to read,
compile, and run java programs.  

Steven plays lots of single player games in his spare time, and because of his tight work schedule as a student, he wants to be able to enjoy his free time, so the game aspect
of learning is a natural draw.  He would download the executable version of the game first, to see how the game runs, then
fork the project into his own github in order to examine how it implements the options presented to him as a player.


# Persona 2
Tyler, age 24, is a professional gamer. He keeps a log of all games he plays. He aims to play and rate every single game in the world. Tyler never graduated college and spends a lot of time at home on his computer. He is a twitch streamer who likes to educate his audience on the vast world of gaming, as well as the many options available to the public. He is interested in games that are not commonly played and not available for popular gaming consoles. The majority of Tyler's twitch audience are between the ages of 16 and 30 years old. He finds that his audience's love for gaming typically overlaps with an interest in coding. 

Tyler is not a proficient coder but his extensive experience in gaming makes him a natural problem solver. He is particularly interested in Text-Based Battle Game because it combines coding and gaming in a way his audience can more easily understand.
