# Vision statement

For anyone who is interested in Role Playing Games, has access to a personal computer and may have little to no previous knowledge of gaming systems who needs a simple and efficient text based game that is both interactive and exciting. The Text Battle System is a gaming application that is easy to manipulate and use as a form of entertainment or a way to de-stress. Unlike other services and providers that offer command line gaming, our product is more user friendy, is open-source, and can be further modified to satisfy the needs of the user if any.
